## Website for the SDIS Terre-Sainte

This is the public site for the volontary fire department of Terre Sainte in the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland.

The site was built using version 3 of the [Twill CMS](https://twillcms.com/).

Some of the features of Twill that were used on this site which aren't always easy to understand in the Twill documentation are:

- Custom Blocks for Block Editor
- Buckets
- Settings
- Nested admin resources/navigation
